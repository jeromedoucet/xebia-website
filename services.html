            <h2>Acceleration</h2>

                Xebia can set-up your IT development in iterative, multidisciplinary agile teams that deliver
                concrete value to production every two weeks. This radically reduces the time needed to turn

            <h2>Software craftmanship</h2>

            <p>The technical quality of a software system determines if changes
                can go live immediately or if expensive stabilization
                and testing is necessary. True craftsmen know how to produce high quality
                systems that only need a minimum of maintenance. But true craftsmanship requires
                practice, training, dedication and discipline. Xebia Training delivers
                master craftsmen that make the difference.</p>

            <p>Our customers find that a fast Time-to-Market of new ideas is crucial
                for optimally servicing their clients. But quickly turning ideas
                into high quality IT solutions is a consistent bottleneck. Xebia tackles the whole IT
                value chain, from the business/product owner to agile development and culture,
                to high-tech innovation to operational exploitation and infrastructure.</p>
